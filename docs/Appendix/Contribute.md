# How to contribute

## Questions and issues

If you have a question about or a general issue while using this library,
head over to the [discussions section](https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode/discussions),
create a new post and describe your issue as precise as possible, ideally add a code example (if applicable).
Please don't just write "headline says all" because the reply will likely be similarly concise - help me (and others) help you!
(just to clarify: the "general" does not mean general PHP support, in which case you're better off on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php) or [/r/PHPhelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/))


## Bug reports

So you found a bug or the library code is somehow misbehaving? That's great (well, not that great tho). In that case,
please [open a bug report and FILL OUT THE ISSUE TEMPLATE](https://github.com/chillerlan/php-qrcode/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D)
(I have to write that in all caps because nobody actually does it which usually leads to several avoidable follow-up questions that cost both of us precious time).
Below an example of the bug report template (it's not that hard):
